# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of sales performance data to identify critical business insights and improve decision-making for a retail business. Using Excel Pivot Tables and Power Query, I transformed raw sales data into meaningful insights, helping businesses understand  sales trends, and market performance.

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Sales Growth(Pivot Table 1)**
   - Sales increased significantly from **~$2.73M** in 2019 to **~$17.36M** in 2021 (mean values).
   - Some customers showed exceptional growth, with the highest recorded sales reaching ~$598.88M in 2021.
   - Sales performance varies widely across different customers.

2. **Market Performance vs Target(Pivot Table 2)**
   - The average market sales in 2021 were **~$49.91M**.
   - Sales underperformed compared to targets, with an **average decline of ~9.1%**.
   - The worst-affected areas had a **15.3% drop**, while some regions showed a milder decline of **~3.9%**.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data storage and pivot table creation.
- **Power Query**: For Extract, Transform and load(**ETL**) operation.
- **DAX**: For Creating the DAX Measures.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding **visualizations** for better insight into trends.
- Implementing **predictive models** for future sales forecasting.
