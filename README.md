# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer net sales performance and market performance vs. targets using an Excel dataset. The dataset includes two main sheets with pre-built pivot tables that summarize key insights about sales trends and target achievements over multiple years.

## Dataset Details
- **Customer Net Sales Performance**: Contains sales data from 2019 to 2021 for various customers.
- **Market Performance vs Target**: Compares actual market sales from 2019 to 2021 against set targets, along with percentage change analysis.

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Sales Growth**
   - Sales increased significantly from ~$2.73M in 2019 to ~$17.36M in 2021 (mean values).
   - Some customers showed exceptional growth, with the highest recorded sales reaching ~$598.88M in 2021.
   - Sales performance varies widely across different customers.
